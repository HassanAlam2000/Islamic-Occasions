              Every religion in the whole world has its own customs, occasions
              and traditions. Islam also has its own occasions which makes
              muslims unite. <b>Islam preaches us brotherhood</b>, as our
              <i>Prophet (PBUH)</i> had taught us that,
              <q
                ><em
                  >Every Muslim is the brother of other Muslim, regardless of
                  his race, blood and language</em
                ></q
              >. So, in that matter, our <i>Prophet (PBUH)</i> brought many
              gifts and blessings from <b>Allah Almighty</b> with him for us. As
              occasions are held by dates, in Islam, occasions had also held by
              dates, but according to
              <a href="#islamic-calender">Islamic Calendar</a>. Every gift has
              its own importance, but there are a few gifts which I cannot skip
              them:

              days. It is used to determine the proper days of Islamic holidays

            <p>
              <i
                >The Israʾ and Maraj are the two parts of a Night Journey that,
                according to Islam, the Islamic prophet Muhammad (PBUH) took
                during a single night around the year 621</i
              >. Within Islam it signifies both a physical and spiritual
              journey.
              <b>The Quran surah al-Isra contains an outline account</b>, while
              greater detail is found in the hadith collections of the reports,
              teachings, deeds and sayings of <i>Muhammad (PBUH)</i>. In the
              accounts of the Israʾ, <i>Muhammad (PBUH)</i> is said to have
              traveled
              <i>on the back of a winged mule-like white beast, called Buraq</i
              >, to <q>the farthest mosque</q>. By tradition this mosque, which
              came to represent the physical world, was identified as the
              <i>Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem</i>. At the mosque,
              <i>Muhammad (PBUH)</i> is said to have led the other prophets in
              prayer. His subsequent ascent into the heavens came to be known as
              the Maraj. <i>Muhammad (PBUH)</i> journey and ascent is marked as
              one of the most celebrated dates in the
              <a href="#islamic-calender">Islamic calendar</a>.
            </p>
            <h3>The gift of Prayers</h3>
            <p>
              At the end, it's very important to inform you that evey Muslim
              <i>have to say five prayes a day</i>, these prayers were actually
              a gift to the <i>Muhammad (PBUH)</i> Ummah. At the very first
              time, <b>Allah Almighty</b> tells <i>Muhammad (PBUH)</i> that his
              people must pray 50 times a day, but as
              <i>Muhammad (PBUH)</i> descends back to Earth, he meets
              <i>Musa (AS)</i> who tells <i>Muhammad (PBUH)</i> to go back to
              <b>Allah Almighty</b> and ask for fewer prayers because 50 is too
              many. <i>Muhammad (PBUH)</i> goes between <i>Musa (AS)</i> and
              <b>Allah Almighty</b> nine times, until the prayers are reduced to
              the five daily prayers, which <b>Allah Almighty</b> will reward
              tenfold. That again, <i>Musa (AS)</i> told
              <i>Muhammad (PBUH)</i> to ask for even lesser but
              <i>Muhammad (PBUH)</i>
              <i
                >felt ashamed and said that even with lesser prayer times, his
                followers might not even perform diligently and said he is
                thankful for the five</i
              >.

            <h3>The Fasting</h3>
            <p>
              <i
                >Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar, observed by
                Muslims worldwide as a month of fasting (sawm), prayer,
                reflection and community</i
              >. A commemoration of <i>Muhammad's (PBUH)</i> first revelation,
              <i
                >the annual observance of Ramadan is regarded as one of the
                <b>Five Pillars of Islam</b></i
              >
              and <b>lasts twenty-nine to thirty days</b>, from one sighting of
              the crescent moon to the next.
              <i
                >Fasting from sunrise to sunset is fard (obligatory) for all
                adult Muslims who are not acutely or chronically ill,
                travelling, elderly, pregnant, breastfeeding, diabetic, or
                menstruating</i
              >.
              <i
                >The predawn meal is referred to as <b>suhur</b>, and the
                nightly feast that breaks the fast is called <b>iftar</b></i
              >. Although fatwas have been issued declaring that Muslims who
              live in regions with a midnight sun or polar night should follow
              the timetable of Mecca, it is common practice to follow the
              timetable of the closest country in which night can be
              distinguished from day.

                field or large hall</i
              >. It may only be performed in congregation and features
              <b>six additional Takbirs</b> (raising of the hands to the ears
              while saying <q>Allāhu ʾAkbar, meaning God is the greatest</q>) in
              the Hanafi school of Sunni Islam: three at the start of the first
              rakat and three just before rukūʿ in the second rakat. Other Sunni
              schools usually have twelve Takbirs, similarly split in groups of
              seven and five. In Shia Islam, the salat has six Takbirs in the
              first rakat at the end of qira'a, before rukūʿ, and five in the
              second. Depending on the juristic opinion of the locality, this
              salat is either farḍ (obligatory).
