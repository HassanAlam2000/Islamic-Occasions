                  a guidance for mankind, and clear proofs of the guidance, and
                  the criterion (of right and wrong). And whosoever of you is
                  present, let him fast the month, and whosoever of you is sick
                  or on a journey, a number of other days. Allah Almighty
                  desires for you ease; He desires not hardship for you; and
                  that you should complete the period, and that you should
                  magnify Allah Almighty for having guided you, and that perhaps
                  you may be thankful.

            <h2>Etymology</h2>
            <p>
              The word Ramadan derives from the Arabic root ramiḍa or ar-ramaḍ
              <i><b>scorching heat</b></i
              >, <i><b>dryness</b></i
              >.
            </p>
            <h2>Practices</h2>

            <h3>The Fasting</h3>
            <p>
              <i
                >Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar, observed by
                Muslims worldwide as a month of fasting (sawm), prayer,
                reflection and community</i
              >. A commemoration of <i>Muhammad's (PBUH)</i> first revelation,
              the annual observance of
              <i
                >Ramadan is regarded as <b>one of the Five Pillars</b> of Islam
                and lasts twenty-nine to thirty days</i
              >, from one sighting of the crescent moon to the next. Fasting
              from sunrise to sunset is fard (obligatory) for all adult Muslims
              who are not acutely or chronically ill, travelling, elderly,
              pregnant, breastfeeding, diabetic, or menstruating.
              <i
                >The predawn meal is referred to as suhur, and the nightly feast
                that breaks the fast is called iftar</i
              >. Although fatwas have been issued declaring that Muslims who
              live in regions with a midnight sun or polar night should follow
              the timetable of Mecca, it is common practice to follow the
              timetable of the closest country in which night can be
              distinguished from day.
              <i
                ><b
                  >The spiritual rewards (thawab) of fasting are believed to be
                  multiplied during Ramadan</b
                ></i
              >. Accordingly, Muslims refrain not only from food and drink, but
              also tobacco products, sexual relations, and sinful behavior,
              devoting themselves instead to salat (prayer), recitation of the
              Quran, and the performance of charitable deeds as they strive for
              purity and heightened awareness of God (taqwa).
            </p>

            <h3>Seher</h3>
            <p>
              <i
                >Each day, <b>before dawn</b>, Muslims observe a
                <b>pre-fast meal called the seher</b>. After stopping a short
                time before dawn, Muslims begin the first prayer of the day,
                Fajr</i
              >.
            </p>
            <img src="./images/seher.jpg" alt="Breakfast meal" />

            <h3>Iftar</h3>
            <p>
              <i
                >At sunset,
                <b
                  >families break the fast with the iftar, traditionally opening
                  the meal by eating dates to commemorate Muhammad's (PBUH)
                  practice of breaking the fast with three dates</b
                >. They then adjourn for Maghrib, the fourth of the five
                required daily prayers, after which the main meal is served</i
              >.
            </p>
            <img src="./images/dates.jpg" alt="Dates" />
            <p>
              Social gatherings, many times in buffet style, are frequent at
              iftar. Traditional dishes are often highlighted, including
              traditional desserts, particularly those made only during Ramadan.
              Water is usually the beverage of choice, but juice and milk are
              also often available, as are soft drinks and caffeinated
              beverages. In the Middle East, iftar consists of water, juices,
              dates, salads and appetizers; one or more main dishes; and rich
              desserts, with dessert considered the most important aspect of the
              meal. Typical main dishes include lamb stewed with wheat berries,
              lamb kebabs with grilled vegetables, and roasted chicken served
              with chickpea-studded rice pilaf. Desserts may include luqaimat,
              baklava or kunafeh.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over time, the practice of iftar has involved into banquets that
              may accommodate hundreds or even thousands of diners. The Sheikh
              Zayed Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi, the largest mosque in the UAE,
              feeds up to thirty thousand people every night. Some twelve
              thousand people attend iftar at the Imam Reza shrine in Mashhad.
            </p>

            <h3>Charity</h3>
            <p>
              Zakāt, often translated as <q>the poor-rate</q>, is the fixed
              percentage of income a believer is required to give to the poor;
              <i
                >the practice is <b>obligatory</b> as one of the pillars of
                Islam</i
              >. Muslims believe that good deeds are rewarded more handsomely
              during Ramadan than at any other time of the year; consequently,
              many donate a larger portion or even all of their yearly zakāt
              during this month.
            </p>

            <h3>Tarawih</h3>
            <p>
              Tarawih are extra nightly prayers performed during the month of
              Ramadan. Contrary to popular belief, they are not compulsory.
            </p>

            />

            <h3>Recitation of Quran</h3>
            <p>
              Muslims are encouraged to read the entire Quran, which comprises
              thirty juz' (sections), over the thirty days of Ramadan. Some
              Muslims incorporate a recitation of one juz' into each of the
              thirty tarawih sessions observed during the month.
