            <h2>Etymology</h2>
            <p>
              The word <b>Eid</b> in Arabic, just means <q>celebration</q> or
              <q>festival</q>. <b>Adha</b> means <q>sacrifice</q>. Therefore,
              <i>Eid ul-Adha means <q>A festival of sacrifice</q></i
              >.
            </p>
            <h2>Practices</h2>

            <p>
              During Eid al-Adha, distributing meat amongst the people, chanting
              the <i><q>takbir</q></i> out loud before the Eid prayers on the
              first day and after prayers throughout the three days of Eid, are
              considered essential parts of this important Islamic festival.
            </p>
            <p>
              Men, women, and children are expected to dress in their finest
              clothing to perform Eid prayer in a large congregation in an open
              waqf (<q>stopping</q>) field called Eidgah or mosque. Affluent
              Muslims who can afford it sacrifice their best
              <b>halal</b> domestic animals (<i
                >usually a cow, but can also be a camel, goat, sheep, or ram
                depending on the region</i
              >) as a symbol of Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his only son.
              The sacrificed animals, called <b>aḍḥiya</b>, known also by the
              Perso-Arabic term <b>qurbāni</b>,
              <i>have to meet certain age and quality standards</i> or else the
              animal is considered an unacceptable sacrifice. In
              <b>Pakistan</b> alone nearly ten million animals are slaughtered
              on Eid days costing over <b>US$2.0 billion</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The meat from the sacrificed animal is preferred to be divided
              into three parts.

            <h3>Eid Prayer</h3>
            <p>
              The Eid prayer is performed in congregation in open areas like
              fields, community centers, or mosques.
              <b>No call to prayer is given for this Eid prayer</b>, and it
              consists of only two units of prayer with
              <b>a variable amount of Takbirs</b> and other prayer elements
              depending on the branch of Islam observed.The Eid prayer is
              followed by the sermon and then a supplication asking for
              <b>Allah's Almighty</b>
              forgiveness, mercy, peace and blessings for all living beings
              across the world. The sermon also instructs Muslims as to the
              performance of rituals of Eid, such as the <b>zakat</b>. Listening
              to the sermon at Eid is optional. After the prayers,
              <i
                >Muslims visit their relatives, friends, and acquaintances or
                hold large communal celebrations in homes, community centers, or
                rented halls</i
              >.
            </p>

              src="./images/eidulfitr.jpg"
              alt="A group of people saying prayer"
            />

            <h3>The slaughter</h3>

            <p>
              After the Eid prayer, every person starts preparation to slaughter
              the <b>animal</b>. When they bring animal to slaughter, while the
              animal is being slaughtered, the person reads the following lines,
              which is known as <b>Takbir</b>:
              <br />
              <b
                ><i
                  ><q
                    >Allāhu akbar, allāhu akbar lā ilāha illā-llāh allāhu akbar,
                    allāhu akbar walillāhi l-ḥamd</q
                  ></i
                ></b
              >
            </p>
            <p>This process usually takes a whole Eid's first day.</p>

              alt="A girl has coins in her hands"
            />

            <h3>The festive meal</h3>
            <p>
              Nothing beats annihilating a heap of aromatic, spicy, princely
              <b>mutton biryani</b>, cooked the royal style! A popular rice dish
              from South Asia that originated in Pakistan, Biryani make it to
              almost every holiday celebration, especially those which need an
              entire crew to be fed. Oozing with vegetables, meat, spices, and
              aromatic herbs, Biryani is a sure-shot show stopper for any
              celebration and is a traditional Eid Al Adha food in
              <b>Pakistan</b>!
            </p>
            <img src="./images/lambdish.jpg" alt="Lamb Dish" />

            <h3>Dinner parties</h3>

            <p>
              On second day of Eid, Muslims usually organize dinner parties
              usually at their homes, many of them organize huge parties at
              hotels or palaces. This tradition may vary region to region. In
              Pakistan, Muslims usually invite their relatives at their home,
              and usually organize <b>BBQ</b>. There is also a term called
              <q>Sajji</q> (Meat cooked on coals without cutting it into
              pieces).
